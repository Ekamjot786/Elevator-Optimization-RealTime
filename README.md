# 🚀 Elevator Optimization using Real-Time Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates and optimizes an elevator system using **real-time video data analysis**. By detecting people waiting at different floors with YOLOv8, the system reduces waiting times and manages capacity efficiently.  

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time people detection using **YOLOv8 + OpenCV**  
- Multi-floor simulation with looping video feeds  
- Dynamic passenger boarding based on lift capacity  
- CSV logging for performance analysis  
- Visualization panel showing lift status and floor occupancy  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- cvzone  
- NumPy
